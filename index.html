                        serious travel bug since she grew up in a military family. She delights in her curiosities and a good chat about branding and marketing.

                        Christian is usually toting his laptop and typing away at some bit of code. Otherwise, catch him if you can -- he'll be
                        riding his bike, which is his favorite pastime, cooking up something decadent or sneaking away to watch his favorite anime.
                        He is a pretty laid back guy who knows how to work hard to play harder.

                    <p>
                        Christian worked overnight as a tech lead to support agents. One fateful night, December 22, 2014, a beautiful
                        new woman in the office grabbed Christian's attention immediately. As he got to know Chimére, Christian realized that she was not only cute but smart,
                        quirky and very loving. After she invited him to go to the Dominican Republic with a group of her friends, Christian decided to befriend Chimére
                        and hang out with her every weekend; such has been the case since her birthday celebration in 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, since then they've fallen in love and
                        created spectacular memories together. Their magical adventures include attending beer festivals, quinching culinary cravings & bike pedaling
                        in Seattle, pub hopping in Atlanta's L5P, hookah lounging in San Francisco, roller coaster riding in Orlando, slot machine exploration in Las Vegas
                        and truly the list grows with each month.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They are life travel partners. They are lovers. They are very best friends.

                <h1>How he Proposed</h1>
                <p>“On my birthday, we boarded a surprise early morning flight he’d booked to San Francisco and we were super stoked. The next morning, we were getting ready for our day. Christian is totally a chatty, jolly, very sweet morning person whereas I’m more of a Sour Patch Kid in the morning. I was told to be ready by 7:30 a.m. (yikes!) so I was on par with my time constraint, and he was so cheerful that he decided to drop me a hint about our upcoming plans: ‘Baby, I can’t keep this secret to myself anymore. We’re going to a restaurant with the best bagels & lox in the cityI’ We finished up and headed outside to catch our ride. </p>
                <p>“We were contending with morning rush hour in San Francisco! After a few near-collisions, the Lyft driver pulls into the area called Embarcadero where the piers and the famous Ferry Building are located. We jetted out of the Lyft and dashed across the street. Christian sought out and was talking to this little woman in a red jacket. When I heard her say ‘Christian Barnard for 2. Okay, I’ve got it,’ and checked us off her list, I realized we’d made it and we were able to relax and take in the spectacular view! </p>
                <p>“Next, the same woman walked Christian, me and about 10 others across the street to a tour bus. Suddenly this guy who went by Ken (or “Handsome,” he explained) introduced himself as our driver and guide for our WINE TOUR OF NAPA VALLEY!! I totally swooned with enchantment and surprise. We got the tour of our lives!
                </p>
                <p>“To return to San Francisco, we rode a ferry boat and saw amazing views. My heart was so full but my belly was not and neither was his. We were hangry! We walked off the ferry, through the Ferry Building, and he stopped us at the curb and said we should get someone to take some pictures of us. I suggested we take selfies of ourselves instead to make it faster (hangry!). After we took several pictures, he took my phone and put it in his pocket which confused me because I was just about to order an Uber car.
                </p>
                <p>He knelt on one knee and said: ‘I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?’
                </p>
                <p>And then he pulled this little blue box from his backpack that I’d never seen, haha! I was completely surprised and couldn’t do much but laugh, cry and kiss his face.
                </p>
                <p>I said: ‘Yaaaaasss!’ I'm marrying my best friend.</p>
